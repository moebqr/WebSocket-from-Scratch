# Simple WebSocket Server and Client in Python

This project aims to demonstrate a basic Websocket server and client implementation using Python. Aim is to have the server echo back any message it recieves from the client.

## Prequesites
Install requirements

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Installation

Once I finish the project, you will be able to clone the repo and run the server and client.

## Usage
Still working on it. Should be able to run the server and client in different terminals.
The server will start and listen to WebSocket connection on port 8765.

The client will connect to the server, send a message, and print the server's response.

## Testing
I will build a code snippet just for testing. Stay tuned!
